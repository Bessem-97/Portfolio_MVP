## Details 

- My main focus for this project was to get a presentable portfolio page ready in time for The School of Code’s graduation event. I tried to design a simple, clean site that I could realistically build in a short time, given the skill set that I had at the time.

## Ideation and Design

- Week 3 of School of code was UI/UX week, and our homework task was to design low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes for our Portfolio site. 

- I started off by putting myself in the potential user's shoes and created some user stories and user personas. I tried to design the site for a potential employer who doesn’t have much time and likely looks at dozens of portfolio sites a day. Thus, I imagined that they would want to see a short and to the point About Me section, easy to view contact information, clear links to my Resume and projects etc 

- I also decided that I would include a few pictures of myself in the About Me section, as I feel that  a picture can say a thousand words. 

- I then went on to create Low-Fidelity wireframes in Miro and High Fidelity Wireframes in Figma. The links to which can be found below.
